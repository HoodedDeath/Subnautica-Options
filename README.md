# Subnautica-Options
Application made to backup/restore/fix Subnautica save files.

The application should be run at least once when downloaded/moved to a new a path for easy use with the Death Game Launcher.

Backing up saves creates a zip file in the save location: [SUBNAUTICA INSTALL LOCATION]\SNAppData\SavedGames\slotXXXX.zip

Restoring saves extracts the save from a previously made backup.

Fixing lag in a save will delete a certain file in the save: [SAVE FOLDER]\CellsCache\baked-batch-cells-14-18-15.bin.
This file was found to cause severe lag after extended play time in the save, and deleting this file will clear up a lot of lag in a save. Backing up a save before using the fix button is recommended to prevent the loss of a save.
